# IVEE2 - a Powerful Programable RPN Calculator based on IVEE

## Purpose
IVEE2 is a port of IVEE to nice!nanov2. The main driver behind this was the limited space left on the original IVEE on ProMicro. As far as I remember only one single byte was free on the original calculator. The original code of IVEE can be found in

Much of it still present in IVEE2, I am publishing this with kind permission of the original coder, whom I hereby want to thank for his great work. Being a fan of RPN calculators and especially the HP lineup, it gives me great pleasure to having bit this bullet and come up with this and being able to present a codebase, that has (in my opinion) great possiblities for the future on this chip. 
Nice!nanov2 is probably best known in the DIY keyboard builder community, where it is used for programmable keyboards and the like. It also has BLE capbility and uses very low power, has an onboard LiIon charging controller and USB-C connectivity. Thus, I can even imagine OTA capability for flashing and in operation for this device. Apart from that, I think of it as a worthy replacement for ESP32 in a lot of scenarios, especially for devices on battery power.
