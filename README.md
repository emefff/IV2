# IVEE2 - a Powerful Programable RPN Calculator based on IVEE

## Purpose
IVEE2 is a port of IVEE to nice!nanov2. The main driver behind this was the limited space left on the original IVEE on ProMicro. As far as I remember only one single byte was free on the original calculator. The original code of IVEE can be found in 
https://github.com/zooxo/iv

Much of it still present in IVEE2, I am publishing this with kind permission of the original coder, whom I hereby want to thank for his great work.
